<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there and thanks for stopping by.  My name is 0x1057(801) - pronounced lost or lostboy. 
   I am a computational mathematician, sometimes indie-gameDev & web3 security researcher.
   My areas of interest are zero-knowledge proofs, securing Defi apps (my fav to work on is Uniswap)
   and cool 2D aRPGs and how to make fresh mechanics in the genre. If I can build anything for you
   or secure anything for you, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
